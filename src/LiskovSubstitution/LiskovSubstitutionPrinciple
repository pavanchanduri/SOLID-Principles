===========
1. Objects should be replaceable with their sub-types without affecting the correctness of the program.
2. Suggests we move away from the 'IS-A' way of thinking in inheritance. 
i.e., break the hierarchy as illustrated in Vehicle, Car, Racing car examples
3. Tell don't ask -> i.e., we should not inquire/ask about the subtype of the object, 
instead we should tell the calling class/method about the subtype. (illustrated in Product, Subproduct code).
