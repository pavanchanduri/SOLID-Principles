===========
1. Software components should be closed for modification, but open for extension.
2. Closed for Modification -> New features getting added to the software component, should NOT have to modify the existing code.
3. Open for Extension -> A software component should be extendable to add a new feature or to add a new behavior to it.
4. OCP often requires decoupling, which inturn automatically follows the Single Responsibility Principle.
